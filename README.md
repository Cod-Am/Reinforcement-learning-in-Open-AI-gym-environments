# **Reinforcement Learning on Multiple OpenAI Gym Environments**
Welcome to my Reinforcement Learning (RL) repository! 🎉 This project demonstrates the use of Policy Gradient techniques to train agents in various OpenAI Gym environments. It serves as the foundation for a larger project I plan to develop in the future.

## 🚀 Overview
This repository explores reinforcement learning through the lens of Policy Gradient methods, applied to the following OpenAI Gym environments:

* BipedalWalker
* MsPacman
* CartPole
Each environment presents unique challenges, offering opportunities to refine and extend RL techniques.

## 🧠 Techniques
The primary approach used in this project is Policy Gradient, which optimizes the agent's policy directly by estimating the gradients with respect to the expected return. Key steps include:

Designing neural networks to parameterize policies.
Using stochastic gradient ascent to improve policies iteratively.
Reward shaping and exploration strategies to improve training stability.
## 🔧 Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/reinforcement-learning.git  
cd reinforcement-learning  
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and install OpenAI Gym:
```bash
pip install gym
```  
For environments like MsPacman, additional dependencies like atari-py may be required:

```bash
pip install gym[atari]  
```

## 🖼️ Environments
### 1. BipedalWalker
Task: Teach a bipedal robot to walk across a terrain.
Challenges: Balancing, leg coordination, variable terrain.
### 2. MsPacman
Task: Guide Ms. Pac-Man to collect pellets while avoiding ghosts.
Challenges: Pixel-based observations, dynamic game mechanics.
### 3. CartPole
Task: Balance a pole on a moving cart.
Challenges: Fast decision-making, balancing trade-offs.
##⚡ Results
CartPole: Successfully balances the pole for over 500 steps.
MsPacman: Achieved a steady improvement in score with training.
BipedalWalker: Able to traverse simple terrains after initial training.
More detailed results and visualizations can be found in each environment's respective folder.

## 🌱 Future Plans
This project is a stepping stone for a larger RL-based project. Future directions include:

Exploring advanced RL techniques (e.g., PPO, DDPG, SAC).
Expanding to more complex environments.
Incorporating multi-agent systems.
Investigating transfer learning between environments.
